However, the optimal response time is higher (0.309 seconds), indicating potential inefficiencies under optimal conditions.

The server utilizations are very low, indicating that the system is underutilized despite an arrival rate of about 48 requests per time unit. However, the optimal response time metric is much higher (0.309 seconds), possibly reflecting expected delays under heavier loads or different conditions. Given the low response time and low server utilization, the system currently performs efficiently. Yet, since the basic throughput (5.43) is significantly lower than the optimal throughput (23.75), the system might not be processing tasks as quickly as theoretically possible. Conceptually, if response times start approaching the threshold or throughput demands increase, scaling up servers could be needed to maintain adaptation goals."

The measured basic response time (0.023) is well below the adaptation goal threshold (0.1), indicating low latency currently. However, the optimal response time indicated (about 0.31) is much higher, suggesting that under optimal conditions the system expects some delay. Server utilizations are extremely low (~0.0023), meaning servers are underutilized.
