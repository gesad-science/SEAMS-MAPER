The measured basic response time is 0.026 seconds, well below the adaptation goal threshold of 0.1 seconds, indicating good responsiveness.

Despite low utilization, the throughput is only about 6 requests per second, much lower than the optimal throughput around 26. This discrepancy suggests the arrival rate may be higher than the system can handle efficiently with current configuration, possibly due to the dimmer being set to 0.9 which could be limiting performance. To maintain or improve response times as arrival rate remains high, an adaptation involving adjusting resources, particularly increasing server count, might be conceptually necessary to better match the load and meet throughput goals."
