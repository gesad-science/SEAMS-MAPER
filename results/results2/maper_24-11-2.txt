The opt_rt is higher (0.309), but the system currently maintains a good response time. However, the throughput is relatively low compared to the optimal throughput capacity, possibly due to the high dimmer setting limiting processing capacity. Conceptually, if response time were to degrade or throughput needed to increase, adding servers could help maintain metrics within goals. Currently, the system is stable but close monitoring is needed to keep response time under threshold while handling arrival load."

Server utilization values are very low, suggesting that the three active servers are underused despite a relatively high arrival rate and dimmer setting. This underutilization implies that the system has sufficient capacity for current load but may approach limits if the load increases. If the system's response time starts to degrade or arrival rate grows, increasing the number of active servers would be a conceptual way to maintain the desired performance metrics."

However, the optimal response time reported is 0.309, which is much higher, suggesting some expected variability or projection under different conditions. Despite the low utilization and response time currently, the arrival rate is relatively high compared to the throughput (5.4 observed vs 23.6 optimal). This mismatch might indicate under-provisioning if the workload increases or if the system faces bursts. The low server utilization suggests that servers are underused, but given the higher arrival rate and latency targets, adding servers could help ensure the system remains within response time thresholds if demand increases. Conceptually, adapting by increasing server capacity could maintain or improve response time under higher load conditions, though no immediate direct action is advised now."

Also, the throughput is low compared to optimal, but with a high dimmer (0.9) and low utilization, the bottleneck is unlikely due to server count but possibly workload distribution or other factors not addressed by scaling servers.

Server utilizations are extremely low (~0.0023), showing that servers are underutilized despite the relatively high arrival rate. The optimal response time and throughput values suggest the system could handle higher loads or adjust resources. Given the low server utilization and good response time, the system is stable but not fully utilizing resources.

Conceptually, if response time were to increase beyond thresholds, adding servers would be the typical adaptation to regain target performance."
